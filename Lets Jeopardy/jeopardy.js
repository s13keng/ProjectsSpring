=== How to build on top of the starter code? ===

Problems have multiple solutions.
We have created a structure to help you on solving this problem.
On top of the structure, we created a flow shaped via the below functions.
We left descriptions, hints, and to-do sections in between.
If you want to use this code, fill in the to-do sections.
However, if you're going to solve this problem yourself in different ways, you can ignore this starter code.

=== Terminology for the API ===

Clue: The name given to the structure that contains the question and the answer together.
Category: The name given to the structure containing clues on the same topic.
